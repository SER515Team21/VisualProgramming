# Pug
Pug (formerly called Jade) is a template engine that simplifies the process of creating and re-using HTML.

## Installation
Pug should be installed in fulfillment of the devDependencies by running `npm install`.

## Use
### Manual Compilation
A pug file can be manually compiled with pug-cli by running `pug <template.pug>` from the command line.
### Automatic Compilation in WebStorm
Create a Pug/Jade file watcher by following the instructions <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/webstorm/jade.html#ws_node_jade_create_jade_file_watcher">here</a>. When the watcher is properly configured, WebStorm will automatically update the HTML files when the associated Pug files are modified.
