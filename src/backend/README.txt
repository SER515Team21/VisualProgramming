This directory should contain the business logic of the application. All the files
should be node.js style javascript. Do NOT use anything GUI related in here. When you
need access to something written in here inside of the GUI, you can add an export to
requirements.js in the node style. That file will be included in index.html as a script
so they are visible to the GUI.
